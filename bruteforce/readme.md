# bruteforce.py

The function bruteforce accepts filename (e.g. "data.txt") as input

## Installation Requirements

Python 3

## Usage

```python
import bruteforce from bruteforce
bruteforce("filename here") # Returns optimal tour, its cost and time taken
```

## Note

I have not tested it on other datasets. TSPLIB datasets were too big to test it with.
